# LetMePlay

Tired of pings and Discord sounds while playing osu!?

Fear not, LetMePlay is here!

With LetMePlay, you can now achieve that new top play on Harumachi Clover 3 mods without any problems! (except for skill issues, probably).



## Installation

Simply download the folder, extract it, click on the .exe, and... that's it!

## Notes

- It only mute discord while playing a map (check if you're playing a map every 3 seconds), not when the game is launched !
- The program will notify you that it is running and will automatically close itself when you exit osu (no notification for the last part).
- **Note:** Only works on Windows. If you know how to make it work for other OS, please message me on Twitter.

### Disclaimer

- The program only mutes notifications but won't stop Discord notifications from showing up. If that's an issue, simply disable Discord overlay (Settings -> In-Game Overlay -> Set "Enable in-game overlay" to off).
- **Disclaimer 2:** Before asking, yes, I made this because I choked on 350 pp due to some random dude spamming me.
