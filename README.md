Tired of pings and Discord sounds while playing osu!?

Fear not, LetMePlay is here!

With LetMePlay, you can now achieve that new top play on Harumachi Clover with 3 mods without any interruptions (except for skill issues, probably). Simply download the file, click on the .exe, and... that's it!

The program will notify you that it is running and will automatically close itself when you exit osu (no notification for the last part).

Disclaimer: The program only mutes notifications but won't stop Discord notifications from showing up. If that's an issue, simply disable Discord overlay (Settings -> In-Game Overlay -> Set "Enable in-game overlay" to off).

Disclaimer 2: Before asking, yes, I made this because I choked on 350 pp due to some random dude spamming me.
